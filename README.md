## LEGO EV3 Robot Project - Group 19

## Team Members:
# - Subham: Ultrasonic Sensor and Obstacle Avoidance
# - Bhim: Light Sensor Calibration and Readings
# - Puran: Line Follower Programming

## Project Description:
# This project was made to create a LEGO EV3 robot that can follow a line and avoid obstacles at the same time.

## Main Features:
# - The robot follows a black line using a Light Sensor.
# - It detects obstacles ahead using an Ultrasonic Sensor.
# - When an obstacle is detected, it smoothly avoids the obstacle and returns to following the line.

## Important Files:
# - MultiSensorRobot.java → Main program
# - LineFollower.java → Line following thread
# - LightSensor.java → Light sensor calibration and readings
# - UltrasonicSensor.java → Obstacle detection and avoidance thread

## How to Run:
# - Calibrate the light sensor when the program starts.
# - Press any button to begin line following and obstacle avoidance.
# - Press the ESCAPE button to stop the program safely.
